Welcome to my FIRST client website - Leannat Co.!
Leannat is a local candle company that produces amazing candles with beautiful rocks and flowers in them!

This project helped me learn a lot about HTML5-Vanilla and CSS3-Vanilla. It helped me understand how to use flex boxes, grids, lists, media queries, forms, and animations to style pages and create responsiveness!
